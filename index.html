<html><body style="background-color: aqua;"><center><h1>Welcome Back To Class!</h1><br><h2>Why Should I Be Vegan?</h2><br><h3>🐮 1. For the Animals
Avoiding animal cruelty: Factory farming often involves inhumane treatment of animals, including confinement, mutilation, and early slaughter.

Respect for sentient life: Many believe animals have a right to live free from exploitation and suffering.

🌱 2. For Your Health
Lower risk of chronic diseases: Well-planned vegan diets are linked to reduced risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers.

Better digestion and energy: Plant-based diets are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and essential nutrients.

Weight management: Vegans often have lower body mass indexes (BMIs) and healthier cholesterol levels.

🌍 3. For the Planet
Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Animal agriculture is a major contributor to methane and nitrous oxide emissions.

Less water and land use: Producing plant-based foods generally requires far fewer resources than raising animals.

Fighting deforestation: Livestock farming is a leading cause of deforestation, especially in the Amazon.

💸 4. For Global Equity
More efficient food systems: Growing crops to feed humans directly is more sustainable than feeding animals to feed humans.

Reducing world hunger: Redirecting grain used for livestock to people could help alleviate food scarcity.

🧠 5. For Ethical and Personal Values
Living with integrity: Many vegans feel their lifestyle better reflects their values of kindness and justice.

Empowerment: Choosing what you eat becomes a daily act of activism and self-expression.</h3><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-q4j_ttUgWmir4-Cwh_Hrg">Follow That Vegan Teacher On Youtube!</a></center></body></html>
